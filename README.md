# This is Pong on FPGA
Pong game written in SystemVerilog for FPGA board. After I wrote Pong in C I wanted to go deeper into hardware, so digital logic was the next step.

## How to run
I've used Zeowaa board with Cyclone IV, because it's the only board I have at the moment. So the run script uses Quartus. If you want to use the script, make sure that the Quartus directory is at `~/intelFPGA_lite`

If you use any other board, it is pretty easy to change board specific module and use your board with preferred toolchain.
